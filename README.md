# Dogfooding 

Solid properties cover tools, systems, and services used for advancing the Solid. The Solid properties are currently maintained using third party software that is not per say Solid compatible. 

The Dogfooding milestone is aimed at transforming the Solid properties to use Solid compatible software where possible as well as advance solidproject.org content for developers.

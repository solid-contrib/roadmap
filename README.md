# Roadmap

The Solid roadmap explains the upcoming plans and needs of the various parties involved in implementing Solid. Read more about how to contribute to the roadmap [here](https://github.com/solid/process/issues/218). 

The [Solid specification project board](https://github.com/solid/specification/projects/1) is the best place to keep up to date on how Solid development is evolving and what is in the pipeline. The Solid roadmap is not the place to read about Solid development however, the roadmap is a place to read about implementation of Solid.

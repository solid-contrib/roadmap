# Dogfooding 

Solid properties cover tools, systems, and services used for advancing the Solid. The Solid properties are currently maintained using third party software that is not per say Solid compatible. 

The Dogfooding milestone is aimed at transforming the Solid properties to use Solid compatible software where possible as well as advance solidproject.org content for developers. 

Items that need to transformed into Solid compatible software include: 
* [Host solidproject.org on a Solid server](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/projects/1#card-41337384)
* [Solid listings on solidproject.org should be in RDF](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/projects/1#card-41337497)
* [Represent elements related to solid/process in RDF](https://github.com/solid/process/projects/1#card-41210779) 
* Many more items of column of [solidproject.org kanban board](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/projects/1) called “to do once there are technical resources”   

Here is a [description of the scope of work and profile of the individual needed to build the dogfood Solid on Solid properties](https://github.com/solid/roadmap/blob/master/dogfooding.med). 

There are several apps that need to be build as Solid compatible apps that would be used by the Solid Team, each of which will need a scope of work and profile of indiviual who could execute the task: 
* Make a Solid Chat app including calling that is good enough to carry out the Solid specification development work 
* Make a Solid app for Solid World invites that allows users to RSVP, get a calendar invite, and an email reminder a few hours before the webinar 
* Make a Solid app for This Month in Solid newsletter 
* Solid GitHub

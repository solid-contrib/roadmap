# Task: Building a Solid Test Suite 
Solid is a technology, like the Web, but a new level of standard which adds to the existing protocols to make it more powerful, particularly to empower individuals at home and at work. At the heart of Solid is the specification. 

The Solid specification needs a test suite. [Here is an example of a test suite](https://linkedresearch.org/ldn/tests/summary). 

The Solid test suite will be used during the interoperability plugfest where Solid servers will be tested against the specification. 

## Deliverables 
* The Solid test suite needs to be built using the stable version 1.0 of the specification. 
* Time to deliver the test suite. 
* (does the test suite need to be written in a particular language?) 
* (insert other test suite criteria) 

## Profile of responsible person for developing the test suite
* Proven experience in writing test suite for other standards 
* track record of coordinating groups with various fields of expertise required in the Solid test suite that are currently found in the [panels](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/panels.md)
